    <h1>Our School Provide Sports & ExtraCurricular Actvities</h1>
    <h2>Action Speak Louder Than Words</h2>
    <p>Sports & Extracurricular activities are great for kids of all ages. They allow kids to be introduced to and practice much needed social 
        skills in a safe environment. Their involvement helps their self-esteem and leads to improvements in other areas of their lives.
        Taking part in after-school or club activities gives them social skills such as working with others, accepting feedback and being 
        responsible for one's actions, and these skills often transfer to other areas of life. This will be helpful not only during their 
        schooling, but also during adulthood no matter what path they choose. During practices and meetings, youth who may be missing skills 
        such as time management and positive peer interactions are asked to be on time and commit to a group and trust individuals. They are 
        building positive relationships within a safe place. They are also asked  to give feedback to help others get better. On a team or in 
        a group such as chess club or band, young people are put in a position to take risks and learn new skills and habits. These positive 
        risk-taking opportunities replace the negative choices often available to those not involved in a structured activity. Many at-risk 
        individuals have low self-esteem and seek positive reinforcement. Sports and structured programs are positive attention-seeking 
        activities. Taking part in track, soccer, basketball, the spring play or cross country will include positive messages and feedback from 
        teams, coaches and sponsors, and help promote positive self-talk. Youth maybe hesitant at first with a fear of failure, and find little 
        success until they let their guard down and begin to trust themselves, their teammates and coaches.
